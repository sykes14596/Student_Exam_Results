# Predicting Student Exam Results

For years, students have been using their predicted grades in an effort to monitor their progress throughout their chosen subjects. More recently, as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, predicted grades have been used by exam boards, particularly within the UK, as a student's final grade. As a result, the accurate prediction of these grades has grown significantly more important.

There were two main aims of this project. The first was to further practice the skills and techniques I had learned as a result of completing Jose Portilla's "Python for Data Science Bootcamp" course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/learn/lecture/17739846?start=0). The second aim was to create models that would accurately predict the score that a student would achieve based on features such as race and the level of education reached by their parents.
